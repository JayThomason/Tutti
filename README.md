###* Everyone can add, move, remove, and change songs simultaneously (if you allow them permission). The music never skips a beat, and the shared playlist stays sync'd in real-time.

* Tutti was developed with the support of engineers from [Audi](http://www.audiusa.com/) and the [Volkswagen Electronics Research Laboratory](http://www.vwerl.com/). 
* Note: Tutti was specifically developed and tested on the Nexus 5, and is not guaranteed to work (or look pretty) on other devices.
